# OpenWiFiSync
- This open source project intents to implement a clock synchronization algorithm for WiFi.
- The current status is the monitoring of TSF timestamps and the offset calculation.
- Basis of the submitted paper: *OpenWiFiSync: Open Source Implementation of a Clock Synchronization Algorithm using Wi-Fi*
